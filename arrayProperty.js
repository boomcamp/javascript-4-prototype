//Just like you can add methods to your own constructor, you can also add methods and properties to built in classes in JavaScript like Arrays and Objects.

//Add a reverse method to the String 'class' so that every instance of String can call reverse and reverse itself.
  
  //code here
  // function String(word){
  //   this.word = function(){
  //       return word.split("").reverse().join(""); 
  //   }
  // }
  
  // var jake = new String("Jake");
